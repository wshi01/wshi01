  A pomegranate so red and so bright,
  A fruit full of layers, hidden from sight.
  It hides behind walls, a false reality,
  An ego that shields, its true identity.
  

  With each piece we peel, we uncover the truth,
  Arils inside, both bitter and sweet, a proof.
  The bitterness represents struggles in life,
  The sweetness, a sign, of kindness amidst strife.
  

  So let us peel off the layers with care,
  And uncover the beauty, the fruit we can share.
